Manna Legacy Code Repository
==================================

### What is Manna?
[Manna](http://www.mannabase.com/) (ticker MANNA), which was launched on May 1, 2015 as Grantcoin, is the first [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) distributed primarily by a charitable nonprofit organization as Universal Basic Income to people around the world. Manna's technology is based on [Peercoin](http://peercoin.net/) (PPCoin), an offshoot of [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin). Like Bitcoin, the Manna network is currently powered by SHA-256 Proof-of-Work mining, and does not use Peercoin's Proof-of-Stake system for distributing block rewards.

### Versions and License
This "legacy" version of Manna is a rebranded version of the original Grantcoin codebase. It is fully compatible with the [Grantcoin legacy code repository](https://github.com/grantcoin/grantcoin-legacy) and the [Grantcoin official code repository](https://github.com/grantcoin/grantcoin), through block 1,100,000 of the blockchain, at which time a mining reward reduction will occur for Manna. The Manna legacy version is distributed under the MIT/X11 software license. See COPYING file and [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) for more information.

### Development process
